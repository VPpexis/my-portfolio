# Website Portfolio

A modern, high-performance personal portfolio built from the ground up using a headless architecture. This project serves as a showcase of my work, built with a "design-first" approach and a focus on clean, structured content.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) for a fast, SEO-friendly user experience.
- **CMS:** [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) for structured content management and live visual editing.
- **UI Components:** [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for beautifully designed, accessible, and fully customizable components.
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for rapid UI development.
- **Package Manager:** [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for fast, disk-efficient dependency management.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Headless Architecture:** Complete separation of the content (Sanity) from the presentation (Next.js).
- **Single Repository:** An embedded Sanity Studio located at `/studio` for managing content directly within the app.
- **Visual Editing:** Real-time content previews using Sanity's Presentation Mode and Next.js Draft Mode.
- **Optimized Assets:** On-demand image transformations and optimizations powered by Sanity’s Content Lake.
- **Strict Dependencies:** Leveraging pnpm to ensure a predictable and efficient `node_modules` structure.
